# Temperature Change Analysis

A simple data analysis project using Jupyter Notebook to explore global temerature changes. This project uses FAOSTAT climate data and visualizes.


## Features

- Load and clean FAOSTAT temperature data (CSV)
- Visualize global average temperature changes by year
- Visualize 10 countries with highest temperature increase and decrease.
- Data Mining uses Cluster Analysis to group years with similar temperatures to see relationships and data structure.
- Data Mining uses Linear Regression to create a linear equation that predicts the 10 countries with the highest temperature changes based on the slope of the line graph.

## Technologies used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
- [Temperature change] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sevgisarac/temperature-change/data)
- File used: FAOSTA_data_en_11-1-2024.csv

## How to run

1. Download the repository
2. Install Python 3
3. Install required library:
	- Seaborn 
4. Open Jupyter notebook
5. Run each cell in sequence and explore the charts

## How to use

1. Load data
2. Clean and preprocess
3. Visualize average temperature change by year
